This technical report describes how to provide routines to include
screening and reverse ratio correction factors for rate calculations
in libnucnet.

\section{Screening}

The dense electron gas present in plasmas can enhance the rate for a
thermonuclear reaction because the negative charge of the electrons screens
the positive charges of the interacting nuclei.  This makes the penetration
of the Coulomb barrier between the two positively charged reactants easier
and thus increases their interaction rate.
Expressions for screening exist in the literature and have been widely
employed in nucleosynthesis calculations (e.g., \cite{1982ApJ...258..696W}).
The question addressed here is how to implement screening in libnucnet.

One way to do this is to compute the forward and reverse nuclear reaction
rates for a zone using the libnucnet API routine
Libnucnet\_\_Zone\_\_computeRates().
Once the rates are computed, one can
then iterate over the reactions and apply the screening function to each
reaction.  Once the screening factor is computed, it is then applied to
the rates for the reaction by using the API routine
Libnucnet\_\_Zone\_\_updateRatesForReaction().

The libnucnet API allows for a more systematic treatment.
From versions 0.2 to 0.25 of libnucnet, the user supplied a routine,
called a Libnucnet\_\_Net\_\_screening\_function in libnucnet.  This then
was called from an API routine
Libnucnet\_\_Net\_\_computeScreeningFactorForReaction.  This then
required a separate application function.  As of version 0.26, this
has all been simplified.  To apply screening to rates in a particular
zone, the user simply writes a
Libnucnet\_\_Zone\_\_screeningFunction with prototype
\begin{verbatim}
void
Libnucnet__Zone__screeningFunction(
  Libnucnet__Zone * self,
  Libnucnet__Reaction * p_reaction,
  double d_t9,
  double d_rho,
  double d_ye,
  double * p_forward_rate,
  double * p_reverse_rate
);
\end{verbatim}

The routine may have any appropriate name.  The necessary inputs are:

\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf self:}  A pointer to the Libnucnet\_\_Zone.

\item {\bf p\_reaction:}  A pointer to a Libnucnet\_\_Reaction to which
the screening is to be applied.

\item {\bf d\_t9:} The temperature $T_9$, that is, the temperature
in $10^9$K at which to compute the screening factor.

\item {\bf d\_rho:} The density $\rho$ in g/cc at which to compute the screening
factor.

\item {\bf d\_ye:} The electron-to-baryon ratio $Y_e$ at which to compute the
screening factor.

\item {\bf p\_forward\_rate:}  A pointer to the current value of the
forward rate for the reaction.

\item {\bf p\_reverse\_rate:}  A pointer to the current value of the
reverse rate for the reaction.

\end{itemize}

Given these inputs, the user's routine should compute the screening factor
for the reaction and apply it as appropriate to the forward and
reverse rates.

With a properly defined zone screening function, the user then
sets it and any applicable extra data with the API routine
Libnucnet\_\_Zone\_\_setScreeningFunction(), which has the prototype

\begin{verbatim}
void
Libnucnet__Zone__setScreeningFunction(
  Libnucnet__Zone *self,
  Libnucnet__Zone__screeningFunction my_zone_screening_function,
  void *p_user_data
);
\end{verbatim}

The inputs to this routine are
\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf self:}  A pointer to the Libnucnet\_\_Zone under consideration.

\item {\bf my\_zone\_screening\_function:}  The name of the user's screening
function.  The user should cast this as a
Libnucnet\_\_Zone\_\_screeningFunction.

\item {\bf p\_my\_data:}  The pointer to the user's data structure.  If there
are no extra data to pass to the user's function, this should be NULL.
\end{itemize}

Once the screening function and data have been set for a zone, that function
will be called for all reactions when Libnucnet\_\_Zone\_\_computeRates()
is called.  To retrieve the data for the screening function set for the
zone, one calls the API routine Libnucnet\_\_Zone\_\_getScreeningData.
To clear the screening function, the user simply calls
the API routine Libnucnet\_\_Zone\_\_clearScreeningFunction().

The example screening function in the libnucnet distribution
computes the screening factor for reactions with more than two
reactants in the traditional manner of viewing the full reaction as a sequence
of intermediate reactions.  For example, for the three-body reaction
$a + b + c$, libnucnet uses the user's screening routine to compute
$F_{screen}(a,b)$, the screening factor for the reaction $a + b$.
It then uses the
user's screening routine to compute $F_{screen}(a+b,c)$,
the screening factor for
the reaction $(a + b) + c$.  The total screening factor applied to the
reaction $a + b + c$ is then $F_{screen}(a,b) \times F_{screen}(a+b,c)$.
For four reactants,
that is, the reaction $a + b + c + d$, the total screening factor would
be $F_{screen}(a,b) \times F_{screen}(a+b,c) \times F_{screen}(a+b+c,d)$.
Libnucnet loops over reactants,
so this generalizes to any number of reactants.
As of version 0.26, the order in which the screening for the reactants
is applied is simply the order in which the reactants are stored for the
reaction.  The user can certainly change this in his or her screening
function.

In versions 0.24 and 0.25, libnucnet applied either the forward or reverse
screening factor to both the forward and reverse rates, depending on
a restricted set of rules.  As of version 0.26, since the user has full
freedom in defining how the screening factors are applied, a number of
routines related to the version 0.24 and 0.25 treatments have been
removed from the API.  Nevertheless, the example screening code retains
some of that treatmenet.  In particular, it applies the greater of the
forward or reverse screening factors to both the forward and reverse
rates.  Again, the user may change this in his or her screening function.

By multiplying both forward and reverse rates for a reaction by the
computed screening factor,
the default network will tend to evolve at constant temperature and density and
in the absence of weak interaction rates to the same nuclear statistical
equilibrium (NSE) that it would have
without screening applied.  This may not be consistent with the physical
nature of the screening.  In particular, the presence of the electrons
may alter the binding energy of the nuclei and hence the resulting NSE.
If the user wishes to correct the reverse
reaction rate so that the NSE is consistent with the screening due to the
electrons, he or she must apply the reverse ratio correction factor
function as described in the next section.

\section{Reverse Ratio Correction Factor}

As discussed above, libnucnet example
screening applies the result of the user's screening
function to both the forward and reverse rates for a reaction.  This means
that the network abundances will tend to evolve to the same NSE that they
would without application of the screening (albeit at a different overall
rate).  If this is not consistent with the user's screening model, he or she
must apply a correction factor to the reverse ratio.  This correction factor
is in fact derived from the
factor by which one would multiply the NSE abundance for
a species to account for the effect of the electrons (or another effect).

We begin by explaining
what is meant by a libnucnet NSE correction factor.
The condition for
NSE is
\begin{equation}
\mu_i = Z_i \mu_p + N_i \mu_n, \label{eq:nse_condition}
\end{equation}
where $\mu_i$ is the chemical potential for species $i$ and $\mu_n$, $\mu_p$
are the chemical potentials for neutrons and protons, respectively, and
$Z_i$ and $N_i$ are the atomic number and neutron number for species $i$, 
respectively.  The libnucnet default is to consider all nucleons and nuclei
as ideal, classical Maxwell-Boltzmann particles; thus,
\begin{equation}
\mu_i = m_i c^2 + kT \ln\left(\frac{Y_i}{Y_{Qi}}\right)
\equiv m_i c^2 + \mu_i',\label{eq:classical_mu}
\label{eq:mui}
\end{equation}
where the quantum abundance $Y_{Qi}$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
Y_{Qi} \equiv \frac{G_i}{\rho N_A}
\left(\frac{m_i kT}{2\pi\hbar^2}\right)^{3/2}.
\label{eq:yqi}
\end{equation}
In Eq. (\ref{eq:mui}) $Y_i$ is the abundance of $i$ per nucleon and
$m_ic^2$ is the rest mass energy of species $i$.
In Eq. (\ref{eq:yqi})
$N_A$ is Avogadro's number,
$G_i$ is $i$'s nuclear partition function, and $k$ is Boltzmann's constant.
It is useful to consider that $Y_{Qi}$ is the abundance per nucleon of species
$i$ if there were one such particle in a cube with side
one thermal de Broglie wavelength in length.
The NSE abundance of species $i$ is then
\begin{equation}
Y_{i,NSE} = Y_{Qi}\exp\left\{Z_i \frac{\mu_p'}{kT} + N_i \frac{\mu_n'}{kT}
+ \frac{B_i}{kT}\right\}, \label{eq:y_i_nse}
\end{equation}
where $B_i$ is the nuclear binding energy of species $i$:
\begin{equation}
B_i = Z_i m_pc^2 + N_i m_nc^2 - m_ic^2.\label{eq:binding}
\end{equation}
As of version 0.7 of libnucnet, the quantities $Y_{Qi}$ and $B_i$ can be
computed from the API routines
{\em Libnucnet\_\_Species\_\_computeQuantumAbundance()}
and
{\em Libnucnet\_\_Nuc\_\_computeSpeciesBindingEnergy()},
respectively.

The libnucnet NSE correction factor is a factor $f_{i,corr}$ that gets added
to the exponent in Eq. (\ref{eq:y_i_nse})
to correct for deviations away from the above treatment.  In particular,
suppose in the correct treatment,
$\mu_i' \neq kT \ln \left( Y_i / Y_{Qi} \right)$.  We may then write
\begin{equation}
Y_i = Y_{Qi} \exp\left\{\frac{\mu_i'}{kT} + \left[ \ln\left(\frac{Y_i}{Y_{Qi}}
\right)- \frac{\mu_i'}{kT}\right]\right\}.
\end{equation}
If we now apply the NSE condition in Eq. (\ref{eq:nse_condition}),
we find
\begin{equation}
Y_{i,NSE}' = Y_{Qi} \exp\left\{
Z_i \frac{\mu_p'}{kT} + N_i \frac{\mu_n'}{kT} + \frac{B_i}{kT} +
\left[ \ln\left(\frac{Y_i}{Y_{Qi}}
\right)- \frac{\mu_i'}{kT}\right]
\right\}, \label{eq:y_i_nse_f}
\end{equation}
where $Y_{i,NSE}'$ indicates the nuclear statistical equilibrium abundance
in the now correct
treatment.  We thus see that
\begin{equation}
Y_{i,NSE}' = Y_{i,NSE} \exp\left\{
\ln\left(\frac{Y_i}{Y_{Qi}}
\right)- \frac{\mu_i'}{kT}
\right\} \equiv Y_{i,NSE} \times e^{f_{i,corr}}, \label{eq:y_i_nse_f_2},
\end{equation}
where $Y_{i,NSE}$ refers to the equilibrium abundance computed from the
neutron and proton chemical potentials and the species binding energy.

An example will illustrate how this works.  Suppose each nuclear species
has a constant potential energy $U_i$, perhaps due to a uniform background
of electrons.  The abundance of the species is then given by
\begin{equation}
Y_i = Y_{Qi} \exp\left\{\frac{\mu_i'}{kT} - \frac{U_i}{kT}\right\}.
\end{equation}
From this, it is clear that
\begin{equation}
f_{i,corr} = -\frac{U_i}{kT}.
\end{equation}

To accommodate an NSE correction factor, the user first writes a
Libnucnet\_\_Species\_\_nseCorrectionFactorFunction() with any appropriate
name (in the case below my\_correction\_function)
which has the prototype

\begin{verbatim}
double
my_correction_function(
  Libnucnet__Species *self,
  double d_t9,
  double d_rho,
  double d_ye,
  void *p_my_data
);
\end{verbatim}

The inputs are
\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf self:}  A pointer to a Libnucnet\_\_Species.

\item {\bf d\_t9:}  The temperature $T_9$, that is, the temperature
in $10^9$ K at which to compute the correction factor.

\item {\bf d\_rho:}  The density $\rho$ in g/cc at which to compute
the correction factor.

\item {\bf d\_ye:}  The electron-to-baryon ratio $Y_e$ at which to compute
the correction factor.

\item {\bf p\_my\_data:}  A pointer to a user-defined data structure
containing any extra data to be passed into the user's routine.  This should
be NULL if no extra data are required.

\end{itemize}

This function has the Species namespace because it generally
requires only nuclear data for a particular species, along with the temperature,
density, and $Y_e$.  The output from this
routine is a double that contains the natural logarithm of the
factor by which one multiplies the
NSE abundance of a species computed from the proton and neutron
chemical potentials and the species binding energy
to account for the correction.  Thus, in
the case of electron screening, if the
abundance of species $i$ in NSE in the absence of the electron effects is
$Y_{i,NSE}$, the user's
Libnucnet\_\_Species\_\_nseCorrectionFactorFunction
should return
the quantity $f_{i,corr}$ such that the NSE abundance with the effect of the
electrons included is $\exp(f_{i,corr}) \times Y_{i,NSE}$.

Once the species NSE correction factor function is defined,
the user may compute the reverse ratio correction factor for a
reaction by calling
Libnucnet\_\_Net\_\_computeReverseRatioCorrectionFactorForReaction()
directly.  The prototype for this reaction is:

\begin{verbatim}
double
Libnucnet__Net__computeReverseRatioCorrectionFactorForReaction(
  Libnucnet__Net *self,
  Libnucnet__Reaction *p_reaction,
  double d_t9,
  double d_rho,
  double d_ye,
  Libnucnet__Species__nseCorrectionFactorFunction
    my_correction_function,
  void *p_my_data
);
\end{verbatim}

The inputs are
\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf self:} A pointer to a Libnucnet\_\_Net structure, which contains
the nuclear network (nuclear + reaction) data.

\item {\bf p\_reaction:}  A pointer to the Libnucnet\_\_Reaction structure
for the reaction whose reverse ratio correction factor is desired.

\item {\bf d\_t9:}  The temperature $T_9$, that is, the temperature
in $10^9$ K at which to compute the correction factor.

\item {\bf d\_rho:}  The density $\rho$ in g/cc at which to compute
the correction factor.

\item {\bf d\_ye:}  The electron-to-baryon ratio $Y_e$ at which to compute
the correction factor.

\item {\bf my\_correction\_function:}  The
name of the user's correction factor function.  The user should cast this
as a Libnucnet\_\_Species\_\_nseCorrectionFactorFunction.

\item {\bf p\_my\_data:}  A pointer to a user-defined data structure
containing any extra data to be passed into the user's routine.  This should
be NULL if no extra data are required.

\end{itemize}

The routine loops over all reactants and products in the reaction and
computes their NSE correction factors.  From these, the routine then
returns the double by which the reverse reaction rate should be multiplied
to account for the electron screening effects.

The user may set a species correction factor function for a zone
by calling
Libnucnet\_\_Zone\_\_setNseCorrectionFactorFunction(),
which has the prototype

\begin{verbatim}
void
Libnucnet__Zone__setNseCorrectionFactorFunction(
  Libnucnet__Zone *self,
  Libnucnet__Species__nseCorrectionFactorFunction
    my_correction_function,
  void *p_my_data
);
\end{verbatim}

The inputs to this routine are
\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf self:}  A pointer to the Libnucnet\_\_Zone under consideration.

\item {\bf my\_correction\_function:}  The name of the user's correction
factor function.  The user should cast this as a
Libnucnet\_\_Species\_\_nseCorrectionFactorFunction.

\item {\bf p\_my\_data:}  The pointer to the user's data structure.  If there
are no extra data to pass to the user's function, this should be NULL.
\end{itemize}

As of version 0.26,
once the species NSE correction factor function is set for a zone,
a user can retrieve it with the API routine
Libnucnet\_\_Zone\_\_getNseCorrectionFactorFunction().  One can also
retrieve the associated data with
Libnucnet\_\_Zone\_\_getNseCorrectionFactorData().

In versions 0.24 and 0.25, libnucnet applied the reverse ratio
correction factor to reactions
separately from the screening.  As of version 0.26,
application of the reverse ratio correction factor to reactions
is entirely up to the
user.  In the example screening with libnucnet 0.26 and later, the
reverse ratio correction factor is applied within the screening function.
Users should consult the example codes to see how that works.

\section{Corrections and NSE}
In order to be clear about the procedure for applying the screening and
reverse ratio correction factors, we provide an example.  Consider the
reaction
\begin{equation}
^{12}{\rm C} + \alpha \to ^{16}{\rm O} + \gamma. \label{eq:reaction}
\end{equation}
The contribution of this reaction
to $dY({^{12}{\rm C}})/dt$, the time rate of change of the abundance
of $^{12}$C, 
is
\begin{equation}
-N_A \langle \sigma v \rangle \rho Y(^{12}{\rm C}) Y(\alpha ) + \lambda_\gamma
Y(^{16}{\rm O}),  \label{eq:diffeq}
\end{equation}
where $N_A$ is Avogadro's number, $\langle \sigma v \rangle$ is the
thermally-averaged interaction cross section for a reaction between 
a $^{12}$C nucleus and an $\alpha$ particle, $\rho$ is the mass density,
and $\lambda_\gamma$ is the rate per second for an $^{16}$O nucleus to
disintegrate back into a $^{12}$C and an $\alpha$.

If the system attains NSE, then detailed balance ensures that forward and
reverse reaction flows come into balance.  Thus, 
\begin{equation}
N_A \langle \sigma v \rangle \rho Y_{NSE}(^{12}{\rm C}) Y_{NSE}(\alpha )
= \lambda_\gamma Y_{NSE}(^{16}{\rm O}),  \label{eq:diffeqNse}
\end{equation}
This means that the ``reverse ratio'' $R$ relating the forward and reverse
reaction rates is
\begin{equation}
R = \frac{\lambda_\gamma}{N_A \langle \sigma v \rangle} = 
\frac{\rho Y_{NSE}(^{12}{\rm C}) Y_{NSE}(\alpha )}{Y_{NSE}(^{16}{\rm O})}.
\label{eq:RevRatio}
\end{equation}
In this particular case, we can apply Eq. (\ref{eq:y_i_nse}) to find
\begin{equation}
R = \rho\frac{Y_{Q,^{12}{\rm C}} Y_{Q,\alpha}}{Y_{Q,^{16}{\rm O}}}
\exp\left\{\frac{B_{^{12}{\rm C}}}{kT} + \frac{B_{\alpha}}{kT}
- \frac{B_{^{16}{\rm O}}}{kT}\right\}.
\label{eq:RevRatio2}
\end{equation} 
If we compute reverse rates from forward rates using reverse ratios computed
from detailed balance in this way, our network will tend to evolve at
constant temperature and density and
in the absence of weak interaction rates to the expected NSE.

We now compute screening.  Suppose the screening factor for the forward reaction
in Eq. (\ref{eq:reaction}) is $F_{screen}(\alpha,\gamma)$ and for the reverse
reaction is $F_{screen}(\gamma,\alpha)$.
If we apply these screening factors, we find
\begin{equation}
R' = \frac{F_{screen}(\gamma,\alpha) \lambda_\gamma}{F_{screen}(\alpha,\gamma) N_A \langle \sigma v \rangle } =
\frac{F_{screen}(\gamma,\alpha)}{F_{screen}(\alpha,\gamma)}
\times R.
\label{eq:RevRatioNew}
\end{equation}

Since libnucnet computes a reverse rate from a forward rate using detailed
balance, the effect of screening on the reverse rate is obtained from
consideration of the NSE achieved.
As mentioned above,
the user-supplied NSE correction factor function
computes the factor by which $Y_{i,NSE}$, the
NSE abundance of species $i$,
changes due to the screening electrons; thus, if the user's routine
returns the correction factor $f_{i,corr}$ for species $i$, then
\begin{equation}
Y_{i,NSE}' = e^{f_{i,corr}} \times Y_{i,NSE},
\label{eq:newNse}
\end{equation}
where the prime indicates correction for the screening electrons.  Because
of detailed balance, we thus know
\begin{equation}
R' =
\frac{\rho Y_{NSE}'(^{12}{\rm C}) Y_{NSE}'(\alpha )}{Y_{NSE}'(^{16}{\rm O})}
= e^{f_{^{12}{\rm C},corr} + f_{\alpha,corr} - f_{^{16}{\rm O},corr}} \times
\frac{\rho Y_{NSE}(^{12}{\rm C}) Y_{NSE}(\alpha )}{Y_{NSE}(^{16}{\rm O})}
\label{eq:RevRatioPrime}
\end{equation}
Comparison of Eqs. (\ref{eq:RevRatio}), (\ref{eq:RevRatioNew}),
and (\ref{eq:RevRatioPrime}) shows that
\begin{equation}
F_{screen}(\gamma,\alpha) =
e^{f_{^{12}{\rm C},corr} + f_{\alpha,corr} - f_{^{16}{\rm O},corr} } \times
F_{screen}(\alpha,\gamma).
\end{equation}
We may write
\begin{equation}
R' = F_{corr} \times R.
\end{equation}
$F_{corr}$ is the reverse ratio correction factor, the quantity returned by\\
\\
Libnucnet\_\_Net\_\_computeReverseRatioCorrectionFactorForReaction()\\
\\
For the reaction in Eq. (\ref{eq:reaction}), it is clear that
\begin{equation}
F_{corr} = e^{f_{^{12}{\rm C},corr} + f_{\alpha,corr} - f_{^{16}{\rm O},corr}}.
\end{equation}
In general,
\begin{equation}
F_{screen}({\rm reverse}) = F_{corr} \times F_{screen}({\rm forward}).
\end{equation}

Libnucnet applies the user's screening function, that is, his or her\\
\\
Libnucnet\_\_screening\_function()\\
\\
to compute the screening
factor for the forward rate and then the user's\\
\\
Libnucnet\_\_Species\_\_nseCorrectionFactorFunction()\\
\\
on the various reactants to compute the reverse ratio correction factor
and the screening factor for the
reverse reaction.  With this treatment, the system will evolve in the
absence of weak reactions and at constant temperature and
density to the NSE appropriate
to the user's NSE correction factor function [that is, once the abundances
reach NSE, they will be given by Eq. (\ref{eq:newNse})].  Note that if the
user does not supply an NSE correction factor function, the forward and
reverse ratios have the same screening factor.
This means the abundances will achieve the same NSE they would have in the
absence of screening although the time to reach that equilibrium would
typically be shorter.

\section{Turning off Reverse Rates}

Some users may find it desirable to turn off computation of reverse rates
by detailed balance.  For example, a user may wish instead to supply his or
her own forward and reverse rates.  While this can be done by updating the
reverse rate to zero after computation of all the rates for a zone, this
is an inefficient procedure.  As of version 0.18, it is possible to turn
off automatic computation of reverse rates by detailed balance for a zone
with the API routine Libnucnet\_\_Zone\_\_toggleReverseRateDetailedBalance().
The user supplies a pointer to a libnucnet zone and sets the switch to
either the string ``on'' or ``off''.  If the user sets the switch to ``off'',
the libnucnet API routine Libnucnet\_\_Zone\_\_computeRates()
will compute only the forward rate for every valid reaction, and
the reverse rate will be zero.  As of version 0.26, if the user
does not compute reverse reactions from detailed balance, any zone
screening function should apply the screening factor only to the forward
reaction.

A user who toggles off computation of reverse rates by detailed balance must
be careful to supply both the forward and reverse rates for a reaction
separately.  For example, if the computation of reverse rates by detailed
balance is on, it is sufficient to supply the rate data for the reaction
\mbox{$^{12}C + ^4He \to ^{16}O + \gamma$}.
libnucnet will automatically
compute the rates for the forward reaction 
\mbox{$^{12}C + ^4He \to ^{16}O + \gamma$} and the reverse reaction
\mbox{$^{16}O + \gamma \to ^{12}C + ^4He$} for a zone when
Libnucnet\_\_Zone\_\_computeRates() is called.  If, however, the computation
of reverse rates by detailed balance is off, it is necessary to supply
rate data for both the reaction
\mbox{$^{12}C + ^4He \to ^{16}O + \gamma$} and the reaction
\mbox{$^{16}O + \gamma \to ^{12}C + ^4He$} separately.  The routine
Libnucnet\_\_Zone\_\_computeRates() will compute the rates for both of these
reactions as forward rates.
