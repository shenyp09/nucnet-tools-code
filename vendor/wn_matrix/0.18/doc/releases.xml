        It is now possible to use a string lookup to avoid printing out
        of matrix element index strings.  This may speed up lookup of
        elements in large matrices.  To use this, compile with the
        flag -DWN_USE_MATRIX_LOOKUP.

        A bug in WnMatrix__getYale() introduced in version 0.8 has been
        fixed.

      <item>
        A number of documentation typos have been fixed.

    <reorganization>
      <item>
        Extraction of a row or column or conversion to other sparse format
        is now done with sorted arrays rather than with lists.  This
        greatly speeds up these operations for large matrices.  The cost
        is somewhat greater memory required to store matrix elements.

        A new "arrow" matrix structure, WnMatrix__Arrow, has been added along
        with an efficient Gaussian elimination solver,
        WnMatrix__Arrow__solve( ), based on it.
      </item>
      <item>
        A new technical report describes the WnMatrix__Arrow structure and
        its associated solver.
      </item>

        New examples demonstrate the WnMatrix__Arrow API.

        The routine WnMatrix__Coo__writeToXmlFile( ), 
        WnMatrix__Csr__writeToXmlFile( ), WnMatrix__Yale__writeToXmlFile( ),
        and WnMatrix__write_gsl_vector_to_xml( )
        now allow the user to provide a format code for the outputting the
        matrix element or vector component value.  Since the format code
        is required (even for the default--%g), this is a backwards
        incompatibility.  Examples have been modified to demonstrate these
        changes.
      </item>
      <item>
        Matrix element assignments and retrievals in some of the examples have
        been simplified. 
      </item>
      <item>
        Unsigned longs have been changed to size_t's in some examples.
      </item>
      <item>
        Rows and columns are now correctly sorted because
        matrix indices are now compared by their long int values instead of 
        their string values.
      </item>
    </reorganization>
    <internal>
      <item>
        Routines to retrieve Coo, Csr, and Yale forms now iterate over lists
        of rows with non-zero elements.  This should speed up these routines
        for particularly sparse matrices.
      </item>
      <item>
        Some internal parameters that are size_t's are now more consistently
        treated.  This should make compilation with 64-bit machines smoother.

        Module is now dependent on gnu gsl.
      </item>
      <item>
        Routines have been added to the API to allow the user to validate
        input vector data as xml, to parse in vector data from xml, and
        to write gsl_vector data to an xml file.
      </item>
      <item>
        Routines have been added to the API to allow the user to get the
        size of and the data array of a gsl_vector.
      </item>
      <item>
        A new routine WnMatrix__solve() has been added to the API to allow the
        user to solve matrix equations using gsl lu decomposition routines.
      </item>
      <item>
        WnMatrix__getDenseMatrix() routine has been replaced with
        WnMatrix__getGslMatrix.  This is creates a backwards incompatibility
        for wn_matrix, and users should upgrade to this new version.
      </item>
      <item>
        WnMatrix__getMatrixTimesVector() and
        WnMatrix__getTransposeMatrixTimesVector() have been 
        replaced with WnMatrix__computeMatrixTimesVector() and
        WnMatrix__computeTransposeMatrixTimesVector().
        This is creates a backwards incompatibility for wn_matrix, and users
        should upgrade to this new version.

        Example codes have been added to demonstrate the new API routines.
